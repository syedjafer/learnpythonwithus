Types of Data Structures

1. Built In
2. User Defined

#### Built In :

As the name suggests, these Data Structures are built-in with Python which makes programming easier and helps programmers use them to obtain solutions faster.

1. List
2. Set
3. Tuple
4. Dictionary

#### User Defined : 

User-defined Data Structures, the name itself suggests that users define how the Data Structure would work and define functions in it. This gives the user whole control over how the data needs to be saved, manipulated and so forth.

1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Tree
4. Linked List
5. Graph
6. HashMap
